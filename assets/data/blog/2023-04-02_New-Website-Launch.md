Hello everybody,
it certainly has been quite some time - but I'm happy to write for everybody here once again.

I've been going through a lot of ideas recently and decided it would be great to relaunch this Website and start treating it better - **I want to share more of my experiences with you!**

As always I have been discovering new technologies and dove more into certain programming topics: Web development, VR, using new Python features / libraries, coding integrations for Slack, Microsoft Teams, WebEx, and even app development.

While on my journey I came along topics, that I do want to write blog posts about, hence this Website had to go through a rework:
The blog from now on requires _structure_ and _new posts on a schedule_.

Because of the reach my website has got, I am not sure yet, if I will continue blogging on the Website itself, or start writing on _Medium_ - however I can guarantee you won't be disappointed about my topic selection, a decent amount of great topics are desperately waiting to get their own blog post!

### Website Redesign

As the post title states, the Website got redesigned. It is now easier for visitors to get an insight of **_who I am, what I do and what particularly I am working on at the moment_**.

Because I do lots of projects in the background, I decided that the Website needs this rework, as I want to start sharing my experiences - _this only works if people get the chance to see them!_

### Blog Future

In the future, the blog posts are going to receive labels and will be sortable using the labels.

##### Here are topics I am planning to write about:

- **Cybersecurity** (Share guides / research discoveries / papers?)
- **Hardware** (What do I use/build, what can I recommend, what is my experience?)
- **Software** (What am I currently using in my daily workflow, why am I using it and how does it make my life easier?)
- **Automation & AI** (Since this topic is very big at the moment and goes along quite well with other topics, such as Cybersecurity & Python)
- **Programming** I plan to write about my current projects, how I handle certain programming tasks and optimise my workflow
- **Games / Emulation** Since the blog should be for everyone and my hobbies should also find their place on my personal website, I also plan to write about Games / Emulation, including topics such as game mods, optimisations and recommendations
